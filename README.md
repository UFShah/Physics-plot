---------------------------------------------------------------------- App Version 0.35 --------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Hello, this is my first app and I only used Python for this app.

This is a basic physics plot maker app, primarily for college physics students.

I am not a professional coder, nor am I majoring in any computer-related field, so this is my first attempt to make this app,

which will give the user some errors that I was not able to reproduce, so I will work on the app in the future.

Also, the code is not very professional, and for the frontend end of the app, I have basically used only one class with no smaller classes

to break the code into smaller chunks, but I will be working on this app


-------------------------------------------------------------------------Next Versions ----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the near future, no big feature would be added; only the base code and how the logic of the code will be improved, and any bugs that would appear

One of the main shortcomings that would be fixed in the next version would be to let a user enter any rows they want to leave.

Let's assume if the data starts from the second row and the user wants to not add that row, there would be an option.

Also, I would make the path input so a user doesn't have to copy the path rather, they can just select the file from the app.

These would be the goals for the near future, and in the long term, I want this app to make Fourier transform plots with the ability to create subplots. 

I also want to make this app model a Histogram to see if they follow gaussian (normal) distribution, or any other kind
